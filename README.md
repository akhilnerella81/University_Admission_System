# University_Admission_System

This project is  a Simple University Admission System.I used Javafx for Graphical User Interface and  MySQL for storing the students details


This is basically a university making its  admissions online and removing the paper/pen process so that Students can register in this online  application and then fill the admission form and submit and then the details gets stored in the database.Admin of this application can select students based on there performance. Students can also see the selected students by the university in the dashboard.


All the files are stored in the application package and the execution of file starts from Main.java file located in University_Admission_System/src/application
